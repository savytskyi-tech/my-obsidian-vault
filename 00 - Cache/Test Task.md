### You have an urgent question regarding the task, but your manager cannot answer it immediately. Are you going to proceed with the task or wait for an answer?

### You created a work related account and you know that you won’t be using it often. Are you going to remember the password or write it down somewhere? 

### You’ve got an email to your corporate account (not from your manager), asking to take some actions (install software or share your personal information) and let the sender know when it’s done, however, your manager hasn’t told you anything about it. What are you going to do?
